## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am an **Applied Mathematics MSc student at EPFL** with a deep interest in the **Mathematics of Machine Learning** and the mathematical rigor behind AI architectures. My academic journey, which began at **Bocconi University** and continues at **EPFL**, focuses on understanding the theoretical limits of current models.

### 🧠 Mathematical & Research Interests
I am fascinated by the behavior of complex systems, which leads me to study:
* **ML:** Investigating the "why" behind architectures and their theoretical boundaries.
* **Stochastic Processes & Physics:** I enjoy studying systems modeling by combining intuition from **Statistical Physics** with the mathematical rigor of **Stochastic Processes**.

### 💼 Experience & Achievements
* **Industrial AI:** Recently completed a **Data & AI Internship at Accenture**, where I focused on the delivery of multi-agent workflows.

### 🏀 Beyond the Math
* **Basketball:** I am a former **semi-professional player**. I am also a passionate supporter of soccer and basketball.
* **Chess:** I am an active chess player—feel free to contact me if you want to play a game!
